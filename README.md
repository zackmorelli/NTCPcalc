# NTCPcalc
This is a Varian Eclipse script which calculates the Effective Volume and Normal Tissue Complication Probability for Stereotactic Body Radiation Treatment (SBRT) Liver plans. 

This is a Eclipse Scripting API (ESAPI) script, for use with Eclipse, which is a commerical external beam radiation treatment planning system made by Varian Medical Systems. This is one of several scripts which I have made while working in the Radiation Oncology department at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington, MA. I have licensed it under GPL V3 so it is open-source and publicly

A more detailed description can be found in the .docx README. Two journal articles about NTCP theory are included here as well.
