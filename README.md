# NTCPcalc

This program is for use with ARIA/Eclipse, which is a commerical radiation treatment planning software suite made by Varian Medical Systems which is used in Radiation Oncology. This is one of several programs which I have made while working in the Radiation Oncology department at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington, MA. I have licensed it under GPL V3 so it is open-source and publicly.

This is an ESAPI script which calculates the Effective Volume and Normal Tissue Complication Probability for Stereotactic Body Radiation Treatment (SBRT) Liver plans. 

A more detailed description can be found in the .docx README. Two journal articles about NTCP theory are included in the repo as well.
